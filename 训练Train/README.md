TACO is a growing image dataset of waste in the wild. It contains images of litter taken under
diverse environments: woods, roads and beaches. These images are manually labeled and segmented
according to a hierarchical taxonomy to train and evaluate object detection algorithms. Currently,
images are hosted on Flickr and we have a server that is collecting more images and
annotations @ [tacodataset.org](http://tacodataset.org)

For convenience, annotations are provided in COCO format. Check the metadata here:

TACO is still relatively small, but it is growing. Stay tuned!

# News
**December 20, 2019** - Added more 785 images and 2642 litter segmentations. <br/>
**November 20, 2019** - TACO is officially open for new annotations: http://tacodataset.org/annotate

# Getting started

### Requirements 

To install the required python packages simply type
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Additionaly, to use ``demo.pynb``, you will also need [coco python api](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi). You can get this using
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.git
```

### Download

To download the dataset images simply issue
```
python3 download.py
```
Alternatively, download from [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3242156.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3242156) 

Our API contains a jupyter notebook ``demo.pynb`` to inspect the dataset and visualize annotations.

### Trash Detection

The implementation of [Mask R-CNN by Matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)  is included in ``/detector``
with a few modifications. Requirements are the same. Before using this, the dataset needs to be split. You can either donwload our [weights and splits](https://github.com/pedropro/TACO/releases/tag/1.0) or generate these from scratch using the `split_dataset.py` script to generate 
N random train, val, test subsets. For example, run this inside the directory `detector`:
```
python3 split_dataset.py --dataset_dir ../data
```

For further usage instructions, check ``detector/detector.py``.

As you can see [here](http://tacodataset.org/stats), most of the original classes of TACO have very few annotations, therefore these must be either left out or merged together. Depending on the problem, ``detector/taco_config`` contains several class maps to target classes, which maintain the most dominant classes, e.g., Can, Bottles and Plastic bags. Feel free to make your own classes.
